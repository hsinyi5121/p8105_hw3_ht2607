================

## Question 1

This problem is using the Instacart data. However, I did not download
the dataset into my local data directory; instead, I loaded the data
from the p8105.datasets using the below code.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

In the “instacart” dataset, there is total 1384617 observation and 15
variables. Key variables such as order_id (numeric), aisle_id (numeric),
aisel (character), product_id (numeric), order_number (numeric),
product_name (character), and order_hour_of_day (numeric).

Need to answer: How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most
items ordered from? Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered
in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items
ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can
read it. Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of
the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in
your table. Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink
Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

## Question 2

Step 1: loading the dataset from the p8105 dataset package

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4

    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2

    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Step 2: format the data to use appropriate variable names using clean
name function

``` r
brfss_smart2010 = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010)
names(brfss_smart2010)
```

    ##  [1] "year"                       "locationabbr"              
    ##  [3] "locationdesc"               "class"                     
    ##  [5] "topic"                      "question"                  
    ##  [7] "response"                   "sample_size"               
    ##  [9] "data_value"                 "confidence_limit_low"      
    ## [11] "confidence_limit_high"      "display_order"             
    ## [13] "data_value_unit"            "data_value_type"           
    ## [15] "data_value_footnote_symbol" "data_value_footnote"       
    ## [17] "data_source"                "class_id"                  
    ## [19] "topic_id"                   "location_id"               
    ## [21] "question_id"                "respid"                    
    ## [23] "geo_location"

Step 3: focusing on the “Overall Health” topic

``` r
overall_health_df=
  filter(brfss_smart2010, topic == "Overall Health")
```

Step 4: include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
overall_health_ep=
  filter(overall_health_df, response == "Poor" | response == "Excellent")
```

Step 5: organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor”
to “Excellent”

``` r
overall_health_ep$response = as.factor(overall_health_ep$response)
```

Answering questions: In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more
locations? What about in 2010?

In this code chuck, I filtered the dataframe to 2002, and group by the
locationabbr variable. Then, I summarizeed to compute multiple summaries
within each group. Last, I filter to states that were observed at 7 or
more locations.

``` r
q1 =
  filter(overall_health_df, year == "2002") |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(loc = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(loc >= 7)

q1
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   locationabbr   loc
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 FL               7
    ## 3 MA               8
    ## 4 NC               7
    ## 5 NJ               8
    ## 6 PA              10

In 2002, states that were observed at 7 or more locations are CT, FL,
MA, NC, NJ, and PA.

In this code chuck, I did the similar step as I described for 2002.

``` r
q1_b =
  filter(overall_health_df, year == "2010") |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(loc = n_distinct(locationdesc)) |> 
  filter(loc >= 7)

q1_b
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 2
    ##    locationabbr   loc
    ##    <chr>        <int>
    ##  1 CA              12
    ##  2 CO               7
    ##  3 FL              41
    ##  4 MA               9
    ##  5 MD              12
    ##  6 NC              12
    ##  7 NE              10
    ##  8 NJ              19
    ##  9 NY               9
    ## 10 OH               8
    ## 11 PA               7
    ## 12 SC               7
    ## 13 TX              16
    ## 14 WA              10

In 2002, states that were observed at 7 or more locations are CA, CO,
FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, and WA.

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state.

``` r
q1_c=
  select(overall_health_df, year, locationabbr, response, data_value) |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent")
```

Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state
(that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
q1_c |> 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(avg_data_value = mean(data_value)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = locationabbr)) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value",
    title = "Spaghetti Plot of Average Data Value by State Over Time"
  ) +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
q1_d=
  select(overall_health_df, year, locationabbr, response, data_value) |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year == 2006 | year == 2010) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = response)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(year ~ ., scales = "free_y")
  labs(
    x = "Response",
    y = "Data Value",
    title = "Distribution of Data Value by Response in New York State (2006 and 2010)"
  ) +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
